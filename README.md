# Typescript Data Structures
I wanted to learn about typescript, so I've started doing the basics!

<br />

### Data Structures  
[Singly Linked Lists](./src/SinglyLinkedList)  
[Doubly Linked Lists](./src/DoublyLinkedList)  
[Great visual example of lists on Visualgo](https://visualgo.net/en/list)  

<br />

Run the tests with
```bash
npm test
```
